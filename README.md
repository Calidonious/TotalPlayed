# TotalPlayed
the TotalPlayed addon for World Of Warcraft

the total played addon records and stores your /played on the characters you login on persistantly
it then adds all the time across the logged players together

installation:
  unpack the zip file (found in releases) and copy the TotalPlayed folder into your addons folder
  
  NOTE: the name of the TotalPlayed folder and the files contained can not be changed
  
usage:
  you need to login to the characters you want to log in Totalplayed so it can log its /played
  
  (the wow api does not allow for addons to get this info without you logging into the character)
  
  you can type /totalplayed into the chat and it will show you the total time played
  across all the characters you have logged in on.
